# Camera Models
For the choice of camera(for a monitoring system) in a university or educational institution, I have outlined 3 different camera manufacturers and their models.

## 1. Hanwha Techwin
Camera from Hanwha Techwin are the best  choice for countries like US, UK and Australia because they very strcit security and safety protocals which are matched and followed by Hanwha Techwin cameras. SO the cameras will be ready to use just as they are.
### 1.1 QNV-7032R(DOME SHAPED) & QNO-7032R(BULLET SHAPED)
These two models are have all the similar specs except for the 'Pan/Tilt/Rotate Range' and their 'build'.
Some major specs and features of these models are:
- 4 MP camera
- Video Compression using H.265/H.264
- 6.0 mm focal length (suitable to capture narrow spaces in high quality)
- IR viewable length is ~30 m

### 1.2  QNO-7012R(BULLET SHAPED) & QNV-7012R(DOME SHAPED)
These two models are have all the similar specs except for the 'Pan/Tilt/Rotate Range' and their 'build'.
